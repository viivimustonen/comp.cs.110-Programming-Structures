This program generates a Path puzzle. The board is ROWS x COLUMNS (5x4), and every round the player chooses a source point and a target point
(totally four numbers), making the given button to be moved to the target position (if possible). The game checks if the user-given move can be made.
At start all green buttons are on the top row, and all red buttons are on the bottom row. Game will end when all green buttons have been moved to the 
bottom row, and all red buttons to the top row. It is not allowed to move a button over another button. When printing the game board, green button
